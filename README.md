# Velocity Verlet Oscillator

Simple implementation of Velocity Verlet integration algorithm for a unit-mass harmonic oscillator. Generates figures of the system's position and energy over time. Demonstrates the varying stabilities of a physical system simulated at different time steps. Also highlights the time-reversibility of the algorithm.
