# Velocity Verlet Oscillator

Simple implementation of Velocity Verlet integration algorithm for a unit-mass harmonic oscillator.

Generates figures of the simulated system's position and energy over time, comparing the result with the the system's exact analytical solution and its second-order Taylor approximation.

Demonstrates the varying stabilities of a physical system simulated at different time steps. Also highlights the time-reversibility of the algorithm.
